incus (6.0.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

    The organization of binary packages for Incus has been adjusted to more
    closely match the packaging provided by upstream via the Zabbly repos.
    This makes it easier for Debian users to `apt install incus` and get a full
    install out of the box that supports both containers and VMs, while also
    minimizing the delta between Debian and upstream package names.

    The new "incus-base" package provides everything needed to run containers
    on a host; if you do not wish to run VMs in Incus, you can safely remove
    the "incus" package and its dependencies from the host system.

    Additionally, the previous packages "incus-tools" and "incus-migrate" have
    been merged into a single package, "incus-extra".
